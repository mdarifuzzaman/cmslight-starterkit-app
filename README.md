This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project is used to create a starter project for cmslight CMS
# Instructions
I have setup couple of files for you.
Layout.tsx -> It has the call to cmslight to get the content for each route
middleware.ts -> The basic middleware is set. This pushes one header (which is the current route) to server side
ComponentFactory.tsx -> This is one of the important component which will be used to create component dynamically based on defined in the cmslight
Some basic components -> Header, Footer and a SampleTestComponent
